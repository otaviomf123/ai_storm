# Ai_storm
Model focused on storm analysis and forecasting using deep residual convolutional neural network, with input data from the goes-16 satellite IR,GLM.

Below is an example of a supercellular case that occurred in southern Brazil, comparing the generator synthetically by the model and the model has never seen the brazil data during training process.
